### Simple Flask App with Github Action 

**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform built around Git (version control system), used for:

- Hosting repositories (code)
- Collaborating via pull requests and issues
- Managing project version history
- Integrating CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Publishing documentation or static sites via GitHub Pages

##### Key GitHub Concepts

- **Concept**	Explanation
- **Repository**	A project folder with version history, hosted on GitHub
- **Branch**	A separate line of development (e.g., main, dev, feature-x)
- **Commit**	A saved change to the codebase
- **Pull** Request (PR)	A request to merge changes from one branch to another
- **Issues**	Used to track bugs, features, tasks
- **Fork**	A copy of someone else's repo that you can modify independently
- **GitHub Pages**	Hosts static websites from a GitHub repo
- **GitHub Actions**	Built-in CI/CD system to automate workflows like build, test, deploy

##### GITHUB ACTIONS

**GitHub Actions** is GitHub's CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Deployment) feature.

- Automate tasks when events happen in your repo (like push, PR, release)
- Run tests, build code, or deploy to cloud platforms
- Create reusable workflows (YAML files)

###### Key Concepts in GitHub Actions:

- **Workflow**	The automation you define (written in .github/workflows/*.yml)
- **Job**	A group of steps that run on the same runner
- **Step**	A single task (e.g., checkout repo, run Python script)
- **Runner**	The machine that runs your workflow (ubuntu-latest, windows, etc.)
- **Event**	What triggers the workflow (e.g., push, pull_request)
- **Action**	A prebuilt piece of functionality (e.g., actions/checkout)

##### Sample Workflow File

```bash
# .github/workflows/python-app.yml
name: Python Flask CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run Tests
      run: pytest
```

##### GITHUB & ACTIONS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

```bash
Question: What are GitHub Actions used for?

Answer: To automate workflows like testing, building, or deploying applications based on events (e.g., code pushes).
```

```bash
Question: What file is used to define GitHub workflows?

Answer: YAML files located in .github/workflows/, like .github/workflows/deploy.yml.
```

```bash
Question: What is a runner in GitHub Actions?

Answer: A virtual machine provided by GitHub that runs the defined workflows (e.g., ubuntu-latest).
```

```bash
Question: What are the components of a GitHub Actions workflow? 

Answer: 

on: The trigger (e.g., push)

jobs: One or more jobs that run

steps: Commands or actions to perform in each job

runs-on: The environment (e.g., ubuntu-latest)

uses vs run: uses runs a reusable action, run executes a shell command
```

```bash
Question: How can you secure secrets in GitHub Actions?

Answer: Store them in the repository or organization-level Secrets, then reference them as ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}.
```

```bash
Question: What happens if one step in a job fails?

Answer: The rest of the steps in that job do not run, and the job fails.
```

```bash
Question: What is a matrix build in GitHub Actions?

Answer: It allows you to run the same job with multiple combinations (e.g., different Python versions or OSes).
```

```bash
Question: Can you trigger a workflow from another workflow?

Answer: Yes, using the workflow_call trigger or GitHubâ€™s REST API.
```
